<h3><a href="https://support.izotope.com/hc/en-us/articles/6658100128273-iZotope-Labs-and-Morph-One-FAQ">iZotope
Morph One</a> (2022)</h3>
<p>This audio plug-in, available to subscribers of <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/shop/music-production-suite-pro-monthly.html">Music
Production Suite Pro</a>, allows users to transform their singing voice
into one of a 6 of instruments using <strong>deep learning</strong>. In
this project, I had a triple role of signal processing developer,
architect, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakuhachi">shakuhachi
player</a>.</p>
<p>As signal processing developer, I implemented the signal processing
sub-system of the plug-in. Collaborating with a member of the Audio
Research Team, I developed the first real-time audio plug-in
implementation of the <strong><a href="https://github.com/magenta/ddsp">ddsp</a></strong>
voice-to-instrument approach invented at Google. I invented and
implemented novel optimizations to enable the algorithm to run in real
time.</p>
<p>The product team created a cloud-connected update system capable of
delivering auto-updates to the UI and DSP components separately, along
with a system for rapid development of high-performance UIs. As
architect, I enabled the team through collaboration, mentorship,
facilitation of technical design meetings, and by implementing important
subsystems such as a novel communication layer between the UI and DSP
components.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/rx.html">iZotope RX
8</a> (2020)</h3>
<p>iZotope RX 8 was a version of the RX suite, an award winning,
industry standard tool for reparing audio. I've worked on many versions
of RX during my time at iZotope, beginning with RX 4. In RX 8 I took on
a dual role as architect and signal processing developer.</p>
<p>As a signal processing developer, I collaborated closely with the
Audio Research Team to improve the subjective quality and run-time
performance of the <strong>deep learning</strong>-based "Music
Rebalance" module.</p>
<p>As architect, I provided mentorship and guidance on technical
decisions and how to effectively use our in-house frameworks.
Additionally I implemented enabling systems for processing to be run in
a new plug-in format, ARA, providing better integration with users
existing workflows.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/dialogue-match.html">iZotope
RX Dialogue Match</a> (2019)</h3>
<p>iZotope RX Dialogue Match solves a common audio problem in TV and
Movie Production - dialogue recorded during filming doesn't match the
audio recorded later. RX Dialogue Match provides an automated solution
to this problem using <strong>deep learning</strong>.</p>
<p>As technical lead, I interfaced with Product Management, the Audio
Research Team, and other stakeholders, and participated in project
planning. I facilitated team decisions on process and technical matters.
I advocated for the use of <strong>prototypes</strong> and <strong>user
testing</strong> to discover answers to critical design questions before
we wrote production code. I advocated for technical work to be done in
small slices.</p>

<h2>Selected Open Source Projects</h2>
<p>My open source contributions can be found on <a href="https://github.com/russellmcc">github</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/russellmcc">gitlab</a>. Generally I take on
projects either to learn new technology, explore my interests, or to
solve a practical problem for myself.</p>
<h3><a href="./posts/2019-06-30-Brinicle.html">An audio plug-in framework
using Rust and React Native</a></h3>
<p>In this project, I explored a framework for creating audio plug-ins
using one language (<strong>Rust</strong>) for the signal processing
components and another language (<strong>ECMAscript</strong>,
<strong>React Native</strong>) for the user interface components. While
only developed to a proof-of-concept level of polish, this project is an
attempt to inspire audio developers to imagine techniques beyond the
traditional approach of using C++ for all parts of an audio plug-in.</p>
<h3><a href="https://gitlab.com/russellmcc/flashcards">A web-based
memorization tool written in Haskell and ReScript</a></h3>
<p>This was a project I developed for my personal use for foreign
language learning. It's a simple flashcard system using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced
repitition</a> techniques. While I likely wouldn't recommend this
particular tech stack in a professional team context, the project was an
opportunity to explore and use new (or new-to-me) technology, including
<strong>GraphQL</strong>, <strong>GitLab CD</strong>, and <a href="https://rescript-lang.org"><strong>ReScript</strong></a>. I'm
particularly excited about the use of the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fraxl"><strong>Fraxl</strong></a>
library to elegantly solve the <a href="https://medium.com/doctolib/understanding-and-fixing-n-1-query-30623109fe89#c2c9">N
+ 1 queries problem</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://gitlab.com/russellmcc/poly-mcu">In-progress design
for an polyphonic music synthesizer with a software layer in
Rust</a></h3>
<p>This is by far the most ambitious and complex hardware project I've
attempted, and it remains in-progress. It is interesting in that it
contains an analog implementation of a filter I originally <a href="https://dafx2020.mdw.ac.at/proceedings/papers/DAFx2020_paper_70.pdf">co-invented
as a digital effect</a>. The software control portion is written in
embedded <strong>Rust</strong>.</p>
<h3><a href="./posts/2019-06-14-Alpha-DCO.html">A CPLD-based digital
oscillator for synthesizers</a></h3>
<p>This project is a modern homage to a favorite synthesizer of mine
from the mid-80s. This project is unique among my open source work in
that it uses configurable hardware programmed in
<strong>Haskell</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="resume-section">
<h2>Technical Hobbies</h2>
<h3>Analog circuit design for musical applications</h3>
<p>As a hobby, I design analog music synthesizers and some other
equipment for the creation of music. I am primarily inspired by the
engineering behind synthesizers from Japan during the early-to-mid 80s.
My designs are differentiated by their open source nature and their use
of modern, affordable parts. Most designs include some digital or
software component. I use <strong>Kicad</strong> for schematic capture
and PCB layout, and whatever software task best fits the project (often
<strong>Rust</strong> with <a href="https://rtic.rs/1/book/en/"><strong>RTIC</strong></a>)</p>
<h3>Connections between Mathematics and Programming</h3>
<p>As an undergraduate, I became fascinated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry–Howard_correspondence">Curry-Howard
correspondence</a> and began a continuing journey to understand
Mathematics and the connections between math, logic, physics, and the
act of programming.</p>
