    <p>A serious problem with callback-based asynchronous environments like
browser-based JavaScript or <a href="nodejs.org">node.js</a> is the
verbosity required to chain together multiple asynchronous operations
(colloquially known as <a href="http://elm-lang.org/learn/Escape-from-Callback-Hell.elm">"callback
hell"</a>). Recently, I was delighted to come accross a proposed
solution that looked syntactically a lot like Haskell's <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/do_Notation">do notation</a>
for promises. It turns out the same trick can be used to implement
something similar to do notation for a wide class of monads. First,
though, a bit of background on promises:</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h2>What is a promise?</h2>
<p>One of the more interesting recent developments in the world of
modern JavaScript is the rise in popularity of the <a href="http://promises-aplus.github.io/promises-spec/">Promises/A+
specification</a>, an attempt to address the common problem of callback
hell in web apps by reifying asynchronous actions into objects called
"promises".</p>
<p>The specification suggests, rather than directly taking callbacks
into an asynchronous computation, the function that starts the
computation should return a "Promise" object that can have callbacks
attached to it. This turns out to be much more easily composable than
calback-based functions. The strategy of reification of control flow is
one more closely associated with "academic" language like Scala than
"workaday" languages like JavaScript, so it's a bit surprising that
promises have gained as much traction as they have. The <a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/">next version of the browser DOM</a>
will even include wide-spread Promise support.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="http://brianmckenna.org/blog/category_theory_promisesaplus">Brian
McKenna</a>, promises as defined by the spec look similar<a href="#foot1">[1]</a> to <a href="http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/monads.html">Monads</a>. This
observation indirectly led to a train-wreck flame war on a <a href="https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec/issues/94">GitHub
Issue</a>. At one point, a functional-programming skeptic claimed that
to use the principle of generalization was to "ignore reality in favor
of typed-language fantasy land".</p>
</div>
<div class="post">
<h2>What about Do Notation?</h2>
<p>The one positive thing to come out of the flame-war was a
specification for various simple algebraic constructs in JavaScript,
aptly called <a href="https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land">"Fantasy Land"</a>. I
thought I'd join in the fun by providing a sort of "do notation" for
Fantasy Land monads using <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:generators">harmony
generators</a> and ideas from Mozilla's <a href="http://taskjs.org/">task.js</a>. Code and examples are <a href="http://github.com/russellmcc/fantasydo">available on GitHub</a>
under the CC0 1.0 license.</p>
<p>This was my first time working with harmony features of JavaScript.
Andy Wingo wrote an <a href="http://wingolog.org/archives/2013/02/25/on-generators">excellent
article on the design of generators</a>, which did a great job of
explaining why various choices were made.</p>
<p>One feature I would have really enjoyed while writing this library is
a way of cloning a generator's iterator. This would allow easy support
for this "Do notation" trick for branching monads (like the List monad).
Wingo writes that the main reason for not allowing resumable generators
are the "allocation cost". I don't quite understand this when we already
have external iterators, because there's no fundamental reason you'd
have to do any extra allocations until a user actually starts cloning
the iterator. If anyone could explain this in the comments, I'd be
really grateful.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<hr />
<p><a id="foot1"></a></p>
<h2>1</h2>
<p>Promises/A+ defines one operation for promises, called
<code>then</code>. Brian McKenna points out that this is similar to a
"return-type" overload of <code>fmap</code> and <code>bind</code>. In
fact, ignoring the error path, the Promises/A+ <code>then</code> is
equivalent to <code>bind</code> in the sense that given one, you can
write the other.</p>
<p>Promises/A+ are actually a little more expressive than a monad, in
that they have rich operations for error catching in addition to the
operations required by the monad structure. One of the authors of the
specification <a href="https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-spec/issues/94#issuecomment-16176966">claims</a>
that to ignore or abstract away this extra structure is to "miss the
point of promises". Regardless, the specification seems to share much
with <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.concurrent.Future">Scala
Futures</a>, and whether the authors like it or not, promises as
specified are monads.</p>
