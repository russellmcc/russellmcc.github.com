  <div id="mdx-content"><div><div class="post"><p>Aliasing is a phenomenon that shows up in a suprising number of ways in the world
of digital audio and video.  &lt;motivational intro - why do I care?&gt;</p><p>Like many emergent phenomena, there are a few different lenses through which
we can think about it.  In this series, we'll try to look at it and gain intuition
from a few perspectives.  I'll try to avoid mathematical terms and
prerequisites as much as possible, although of course we'll learn mathematical
ways of thinking throughout the series - that's kind of the point.</p></div><div class="post"><p>First, let's talk about movies.  Let's imagine that we're making a movie of a
spinning googly eye.  It's gunna be a hit, I can feel it.</p><p>Movies are created by taking still pictures very rapidly - 24 times a second is
the current standard.  Each of these still pictures is a frame of the movie.
Here's an illustration:</p></div><div class="post"><div><svg width="300" height="100" style="display:block;margin:20px auto"><circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" fill="#ddd"></circle><circle cx="50" cy="50" r="15" fill="#000"></circle><circle cx="250" cy="50" r="50" fill="#ddd"></circle><circle cx="250" cy="50" r="15" fill="#000"></circle><rect width="15" x="150" y="50" height="50" fill="#444"></rect><rect width="15" x="150" y="0" height="0" fill="rgb(241,41,100)"></rect></svg></div><p>Googly eye spin rate: <span class="idyll-dynamic">0.05</span> cycles per second</p><p>Frame Rate: <span class="idyll-dynamic">2.00</span>
frames per second</p></div><div class="post"><p>If this diagram seems overwhelming, don't worry, we'll break this down section by section.</p><p>On the left is the real googly eye we're taking a movie of.  The googly eye is spinning
at a rate of <span class="idyll-dynamic">0.05</span>
cycles per second.  You can adjust the rate by dragging the number left and right.  In fact,
any red number in this series can be adjusted this way.</p><p>In the center is the camera.  This takes a photo of the googly eye <span class="idyll-dynamic">2.00</span> times in each second.  This is represented
by a timer bar - each time it fills up, we'll take a photo.</p><p>On the right is the movie we're recording.  At high frame rates and low spin rates, this
will look pretty close to the original googly eye, but at higher spin rates and lower
frame rates, this will start to look pretty different.</p></div></div></div><script src="./index.js"></script>
