    <p>Some time ago, I bought an Epiphone Thunderbird Pro bass. I love the
look of this bass, kind of a mix of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_Thunderbird">Gibson
Thunderbird</a> and the <a href="http://www.matsumoku.org/models/ariaproii/bass/sb/sb.html">Aria
Pro II</a> basses from the 80s.</p>
<p>There were a few things I didn't like about it though - first of all,
the pickguard was a bit ugly, so I replaced it with one lasercut from <a href="https://www.inventables.com/technologies/leopardwood--2">leopardwood</a>.</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Even after changing the pickguard, I wasn't crazy about the sound.
It's an active bass, meaning that it has a battery and a pre-amp
on-board to shape the sound. Sensing a fun project, I designed a small,
cheap pre-amp to replace the existing one. Like all of my electronic
designs, the pre-amp is open-source with a permissive license. You can
see more details <a href="https://github.com/russellmcc/basspre-mm2">on
github</a>.</p>
<p>The design is heavily based on the first version of the pre-amp
included in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Man_StingRay">Music Man
Stingray</a>, a design overseen by Leo Fender. The first version of the
StingRay pre-amp has only two controls, Bass and Treble (really, what
else do you need?).</p>
<p>My version is quite close to that original Music Man design in
frequency response, but uses modern components for lower power
consumption. In tests, my pre-amp uses about 1.5 milliamps, giving
approximately 400 hours of play time with a normal nine volt
battery.</p>
<p>If you're interested in seeing lots of graphs of the response, all
settings of interest are <a href="https://github.com/russellmcc/basspre-mm2">on the project's github
page</a>, including simulations and real-world tests. My favorite
setting is both bass and treble boosted, giving a "scooped" frequency
response:</p>

<p>The build process was identical to my last few electronics projects,
with boards printed by the still-awesome <a href="https://oshpark.com">OSH Park</a>, and then built by me using
laser-cut stencils and a toaster oven. Here's a few pictures of the
completed board in the bass:</p>

<p><img src="../images/bass-wire-mess.jpg" alt="Mess of Wires" /></p>
<p>Installing the pre-amp was fairly easy, but I did have to wrap the
entire board in electrical tape to prevent it from rubbing against the
conductive walls of the electronics chamber and causing noise.</p>
