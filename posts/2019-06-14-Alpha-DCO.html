    <p>It's been a while, but I've released yet another completed eurorack
oscillator design. This one is based on another classic 80s design, this
time a high-frequency purely digital oscillator.</p>

<h1>background</h1>
<p>A synthesizer oscillator's job is to create an audio waveform at a
controllable frequency. In polyphonic synthesizers, stable tuning is
especially important, since the human ear is very sensitive to
out-of-tune notes when chords are played. Unfortunately, it's not
particularly easy or cost-effective to create an analog oscillator with
stable tuning. For a great summary of the techniques engineers have used
to stabilize analog oscillators, please see <a href="http://www.openmusiclabs.com/2015/03/temperature-compensation-of-analog-exponential-converters/trackback/index.html">this
report by open music labs</a>. The challenges of cheaply stabilizing
oscillators led to the designs of <a href="file:///posts/2013-12-01-DCO.html">digitally controlled
oscillators</a>, where an analog oscillator is synchronized to a digital
oscillator. Roland's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Juno-60">juno</a> series of
synthesizers initially used DCOs, but switched to a purely digital
design for the alpha juno line. This design is heavily inspired by the
one from the alpha juno series.</p>

<h1>why does it go so fast?</h1>
<p>One traditional problem with digital oscillators is the problem of
<em>aliasing</em>. Aliasing usually shows up in the context of digital
recordings - if we try to sample audio signals that contain high
frequencies, they appear in our recordings as low frequencies. It's
impossible to distinguish these "aliased" low frequencies from low
frequencies that were actually there, so a proper recording can never be
recovered once aliasing is introduced. The normal answer to this is to
apply an analog low-pass filter to the signal before sampling so that no
high frequencies will remain by the time we get around to sampling.</p>
<p>So, aliasing can destroy digital recordings, but what do they have to
do with digital oscillators? Well, it's a bit of a complicated answer
(and one that I hope to answer more fully in a future post), but
basically, the first algorithm you'd think of for a digital saw wave is
equivalent to sampling an analog saw wave. But, an analog saw wave
contains a full harmonic series, which is to say, infinitely high
frequencies. So, no matter how high our sampling rate, we'll get some
aliasing in our output. There are other algorithms for generating saw
waves that don't have this problem, but we'll leave those for another
day.</p>
<p>This oscillator (and the alpha juno it's based on), use this naive
algorithm that's equivalent to sampling an analog saw wave. So, how come
they don't have audible aliasing? They run the algorithm at a very high
sampling rate. Since the amplitudes of each harmonic in a saw wave are
lower than the last, by setting our sampling rate to much higher than
the rate of the saw wave, we can ensure that any aliased harmonics are
fairly low in amplitude. For typical audio rates (say, 400 hertz), the
alpha juno runs the oscillator at 2 megahertz! This is much faster than
digital to analog converters that we are used to, which run in the low
kilohertz (typically 48 kilohertz these days).</p>
<p>Audio people usually think of using high sampling rates to reproduce
high frequency signals; but in this case we're using the high sampling
rate to reproduce low frequency signals with a simple algorithm.</p>

<h1>how does it go so fast?</h1>
<p>Outputting a signal at 2 megahertz or above is not realistic using a
cheap microcontroller, even using recent chips. However, it's totally
reasonable for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">fpgas</a>
or cplds, which are programmable logic circuits rather than
microprocessors. In this case, we have a very inexpensive (a dollar or
two) <a href="https://www.latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD/MachXO">lattice
MachXO CPLD</a>, connected directly to a simple R2R DAC.</p>
<p>The cpld is programmed using haskell, which can be transpiled to
verilog through the <a href="https://clash-lang.org">clash</a>
compiler.</p>
<p>To manage the analog to digital converter, I'm using an avr
microcontroller programmed with the arduino tools. This using tuning
look tables and sends the cpld tuning data over a bespoke parallel
interface.</p>
<p>The four-layer PCB was designed with kicad.</p>
<p>As usual, all the design files are available on <a href="https://github.com/russellmcc/alphaosc">github</a>.</p>

<h1>how does it get tuned?</h1>
<p>One of my biggest surprises doing this project was the complexity of
designing a proper tuning procedure for the oscillator. There's a fair
number of parameters in the tuning system, and interesting trade-offs
for each choice. This is written up in detail in a <a href="https://github.com/russellmcc/alphaosc/blob/master/design/Frequency%20Accuracy.ipynb">jupyter
notebook</a> in the source repo.</p>
